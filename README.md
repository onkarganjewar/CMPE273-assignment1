# CMPE273 – Assignment 1
# Virtual stock trading system in Golang
System allows user to simulate the trading of stocks using real-time pricing via Yahoo Finance API. The system supports USD currency only. 
## Features   
There are 2 components in the system: Client and Server. JSON-RPC Client will take command line input and sends request to the server. Server will have JSON-RPC interface for providing various features provided in the system such as Buying or Selling Stocks & Checking the portfolio.    
•	Buying Stocks   
•	Checking portfolio  

## Requirements  
•	Golang latest stable version (I have used go1.5 on Windows)   
•	You can check the official golang releases here: https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html  

## Installation

### Installing Go (In case if you don't have it)
•	There are various ways to install go according to the operating system that you’re working on.   
•	All the required files and step-by-step instructions can be found here : https://golang.org/doc/install    

### Installing Package
After you have installed the Golang then run the following command      
```
go get github.com/onkarganjewar/CMPE273-assignment1
```

## Usage
Start the server    
```
go run server.go  
```

Run the client with localhost   
```
go run client.go 127.0.0.1  
```

After successful deployment you will be getting this on client side
```
Enter the stock symbol and percentage of share to buy
```


Now, enter the details about the stocks in the following format; suppose you want to buy 50% of your budget to buy stocks of Google (GOOG) and remaining 50% to buy stocks of Yahoo (YHOO) then enter the details such as   
```
"GOOG:50%,YHOO:50%”  
```


The console now looks something like this

Now in order to check your portfolio for profit/loss details enter the autogenerated trade id like 1 and if the market is closed then you will get 0 as the default profit/loss amount like this
